            A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers (translators
            that generate machine code from source code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code,
            where no pre-runtime translation takes place). The term is somewhat vague. In principle, any language can be
            implemented with a compiler or with an interpreter.[1] A combination of both solutions is also common: a
            compiler can translate the source code into some intermediate form (often called p-code or bytecode), which
            is then passed to an interpreter which executes it.

            interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute
            instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.
            The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more
            subroutines, and then into another language (often machine code). The terms interpreted language and
            compiled language are not well defined because, in theory, any programming language can be either
            interpreted or compiled. In modern programming language implementation, it is increasingly popular for a
            platform to provide both options. Interpreted languages can also be contrasted with machine languages.
            Functionally, both execution and interpretation mean the same thing — fetching the next instruction
